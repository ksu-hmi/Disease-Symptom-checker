# Symptom-Checker
This model predicts the disease by providing different symptoms
                      
                      Description:
In this project i had a data which had different varieties and a large number of symptoms , and it detects the disease from those symptoms.

                      About the Project:
I used SVC for classification and my model is giving a 100 percent accuracy, which is indeed a good point. I also perfomed data cleaning and analysed the data thoroughly.
The system uses machine learning, specifically Support Vector Classification (SVC), to analyze user-input symptoms and predict potential conditions. The training data includes a wide range of symptoms mapped to corresponding diseases. The goal is to provide early, accessible health assessments and recommend whether home care, a doctor's consultation, or emergency medical attention is needed in order to enable the patient to make a personalized decision.

Project Overview:
This project focuses on developing an AI-powered tool that predicts possible diseases based on the symptoms provided by the user. It aims to assist individuals, parents, elderly patients, medical professionals, and health enthusiasts in assessing the severity of symptoms and suggesting the next steps for care.
